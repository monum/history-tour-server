## T Tours

T Tours is an audio tour application that highlights sites visible within walking distance of MBTA's (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) public transportation stops. Each tour consists of a mixture of crowd-sourced audio clips produced by Bostonians and MONUM's staff members. As the user moves along the route, the audio will automatically play based on their location. This immersive experience is enhanced with historical images, the address, and links to additional content relevant to their listening.
